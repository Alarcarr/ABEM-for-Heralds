TARGETINGSENSOR_DESC: <<
	Sophisticated targeting and tracking sensors allow a weapon to more accurately find its destination, increasing its effective range.

	[img=Plus;22;#cf00ff]Can be placed on weapon subsystems.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Increases the [b][color=#80ffea]range[/color][/b] of the weapon.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Increases the build cost of the weapon by 50%.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Slightly increases the [b][color=#fefc61]supply cost[/color][/b] of firing the weapon.[/img]
	[i][color=#aaa]Placing more than one targeting sensor on a weapon will continue to increase its range, but will also skyrocket its costs.[/color][/i]
>>

S_TITAN_HULL_DESC: <<
	An extremely heavy hull frame that allows larger ships to be constructed more efficiently.

	[img=Plus]Much more internal space available.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Reduces build costs by up to 50% as the ship size gets bigger.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Rigorous construction increases turret potential firing arcs.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Can only be used for ships of size 500 or greater.[/img]
>>

S_CARRIER_HULL_DESC: <<
	A hull specifically designed to control and maintain a large fleet of support ships.

	[img=Plus]Doubles any support capacity.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Doubles all health.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Increases supply capacity by 50%.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Cannot have any weapons on the flagship.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Less internal space available.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20][i][color=#aaa]Carrier Hulls can only be used on ships of size 300 or greater.[/color][/i][/img]
>>

S_DESTROYER_HULL_DESC: <<
	A hull optimized to fit many different weapon turrets at the cost of being unable to field a support fleet.

	[img=Plus]Increases all health by 200%, and increases armor damage resistance by 100%.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Decreases mass by 50%.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Increases repair rate by 200%.[/img]
	[img=Plus]More internal space available.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Cannot have any support command on the flagship.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Weapon range reduced by 30%.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20][i][color=#aaa]Destroyer Hulls can only be used on ships of size 300 or greater.[/color][/i][/img]
>>

S_SHIELDED_AMGEN_DESC: <<
	A sustained matter-antimatter annihilation reaction provides continuous power for the ship. This generator comes with a built-in shield generator to protect it, allowing it to operate at full output - though much of it is used by the shield - even in combat.

	[img=ResourceIcon::2;22]Provides a [b][color=#0f0]very large[/color][/b] amount of [b][color=#42b4bd]Power[/color][/b] to operate other subsystems.[/img]
	[img=AttributeIcons::4;22]Provides a [b][color=#0f0]high[/color] [color=#fefc61]Resupply Rate[/color][/b]. Minor resupply even in [color=#ff0000][b]Combat[/b][/color].[/img]
	[img=Plus]Does not destroy the ship when damaged.[/img]
	[img=Minus]High construction and moderate maintenance costs.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Provides less power and resupplies the ship slower than a regular antimatter generator.[/img]
>>

S_ZPG_DESC: <<
	An artificial quantum singularity harnessed to provide immense quantities of power.

	[img=ResourceIcon::2;22]Provides a [b][color=#0f0]large to huge[/color][/b] amount of [b][color=#42b4bd]Power[/color][/b] to operate other subsystems, depending on its size.[/img]
	[img=AttributeIcons::4;22]Provides a [b][color=#0f0]high[/color][/b] [b][color=#fefc61]Resupply Rate[/color][/b], somewhat lower than that of Antimatter Generators.[/img]
	[img=Plus]No maintenance cost.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Very high construction and Labor costs.[/img]
>>

S_TORPEDOLAUNCHER_DESC: <<
	Launches massive, slow-moving, guided bombs. These bombs explode in an area around their target.

	[img=Plus]Extreme [b][color=#ff8080]damage[/color][/b].[/img]
	[img=Plus]No firing arc limitations.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Deals damage in an area.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Very slow fire rate.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Very low [b][color=#ff8080]DPS[/color][/b].[/img]
>>

SUPPORTSUPPLY_DESC: <<
	A secondary supply storage facility may be placed on particular support ships, increasing the amount of ammunition and general combat materials available to the fleet.

	[img=AttributeIcons::4;22]Provides [b][color=#fefc61]Supply Capacity[/color][/b] to the fleet.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Adds maintenance cost to the support ships.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Destroyed supply storage hexes leak supplies over time.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20;#f00][i][color=#faa]Support ships with maintenance costs will not be created by Defense.[/color][/i][/img]
>>

S_REMNANTSHIELD_DESC: <<
	Incredibly advanced Progenitor technology. Creates a powerful shield around the vessel, blocking some incoming damage.

	[img=Plus]Creates regenerating barrier against damage.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Stronger than covariant shields.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Regenerates faster than standard shields.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Weakened shields allow some damage through.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Very expensive, and requires a lot of Power.[/img]
>>
S_COVARIANT_SHIELD_DESC: <<
	Creates a shield around the vessel, blocking some incoming damage. Covariant shields are more powerful, but they regenerate at a slower rate than their standard counterparts.

	[img=Plus]Creates regenerating barrier against damage.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Weakened shields allow some damage through.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Increased capacity.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Reduced regenration.[/img]
