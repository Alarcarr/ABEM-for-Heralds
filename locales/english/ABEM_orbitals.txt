ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER_DESC: <<
	A series of powerful generators and emitters transmits additional power to any ships in need of it. This power is then harnessed to charge up the ships' shield capacitors. However, shield activity disrupts the transmission beam, so combat will prevent continued charging.
	
	Increases the out-of-combat shield recharge rate of all ships in the system by 25, plus 0.01% of the ships' shield capacity.
