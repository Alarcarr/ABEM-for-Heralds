ABL_SCUTTLEDERELICT: Scuttle Derelict Ship
ABL_SCUTTLEDERELICT_DESC: <<
	Sends a demolition crew to plant charges on the target derelict. The remains of the target ship are destroyed.
>>
ABL_BOARDING_PARTY: Send Boarding Party
ABL_BOARDING_PARTY_DESC: <<
	Transports a boarding party to the target object, initiating a boarding action.
	
	Boarding takes between 10 (overwhelming force on either side) and 100 (completely equal numbers) seconds to complete. If the defenders are defeated, control of the object is immediately transferred to the attacking empire. If not, nothing happens.
	
	Only one boarding action can be running on an object at any given time, and Verdant-owned objects cannot be boarded. Boarding actions cannot be initiated by ships which are already being boarded. Asteroids and orbitals always have 100 boarding strength.
