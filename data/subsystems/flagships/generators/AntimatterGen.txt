		// OH MY GOD NO WONDER IT EXPLODES WHEN SNEEZED AT HOW CAN ANYONE USE THIS
		// Shielded Antimatter suddenly sounds like a straight upgrade, even with its slight inferiority and high maintenance. *shudders*
		// Maybe we should come up with a slightly less catastrophic response to exploding. Oooor some kind of 'warp core ejection' modifier to make avoiding disaster just -a little- easier...
		// Who in their right mind would use antimatter when singularities are safer -and- more powerful? I smell an impending buff. Or a nerf. :/
		// Must stop commenting on this. This is not why I am here.
