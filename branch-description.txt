The purpose of this branch is unclear due to an issue that was fixed by the new branch description format.

Since 1.3.0, Rising Stars requires the SR2 Community Patch to be installed, from the branch "master". SR2MM versions 1.1.0 and above will automatically install the Community Patch when you try to install Rising Stars from this branch.
