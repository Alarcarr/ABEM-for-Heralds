This branch consistently tracks the Steam Workshop version of Rising Stars. If it's on the Workshop, it's here - and vice versa.

Since 1.3.0, Rising Stars requires the SR2 Community Patch to be installed, from the branch "master". SR2MM versions 1.1.0 and above will automatically install the Community Patch when you try to install Rising Stars from this branch.
