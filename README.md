# Rising Stars

Instructions for modders forking this:

1. Follow the instructions outlined by Darloth in issue #20, located at https://github.com/DaloLorn/Rising-Stars/issues/20.

2. Create a .steam file containing the text `355873534` in the `Rising Stars` folder (the one containing the file `modinfo.txt`). This will prevent you from accidentally pushing your work to the Workshop instead of GitHub.

3. Run `init-git.sh` in order to do some repository-specific configuration. (If you're curious or concerned about this script, you can inspect the file in any text editor.)
