CONS_MOON_BASE_DESC: <<
	Construct a large amount of infrastructure on one of the planet's moons, making more area available for placing buildings and increasing the maximum population of the planet by 2.

	Only one moon base may be constructed for every moon present in orbit of the planet.

	Mechanoid races receive §100k additional income from each moon base they own.
>>
C_TERRAFORMING_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Modifying the climate or constructing the required support infrastructure to easily sustain large amounts of people or equipment within a certain area is usually a slow venture.
	
	An industrial-scale project sponsored by the empire can accelerate the process considerably, for a price.[/i][/color]
	
	Develops up to 15 randomly selected tiles.
>>
C_HABITATRING_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Constructing a large ring-shaped station encircling the planet provides more space for the construction of important infrastructure.[/i][/color]
	
	Adds a 4x8 chunk of fully-developed Artificial tiles to the planet. Can only be built once per planet.

C_HABITATRING: Orbital Habitation Ring
C_TERRAFORMING: Infrastructural Development
C_SUBSURFACE_HABITATS: Subsurface Habitation Complex
C_SUBSURFACE_NO_FLOATING_CONTINENT: [i]Subsurface habitats cannot be built while a Floating Continent is present on the planet surface. Move the Floating Continent to a different planet before attempting to construct them.[/i]
C_SUBSURFACE_HABITATS_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Constructing an underground complex kilometers underneath the planet's surface provides more space for the construction of important infrastructure.[/i][/color]

	Adds a 10x2 chunk of fully-developed Artificial tiles to the planet. Can only be built once per planet. Unlocks the 'Expand Subsurface Complex' construction.

C_EXPAND_SUBSURFACE: Expand Subsurface Complex
C_EXPAND_SUBSURFACE_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Expanding our subsurface habitats grants us even more space for the construction of important infrastructure.[/i][/color]

	Adds a 10x1 chunk of fully-developed Artificial tiles to the planet. Subsequent subsurface habitat expansions will require increasingly large amounts of Ore and Labor to construct.
