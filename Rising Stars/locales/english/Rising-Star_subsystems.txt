S_CERAMICARMOR_DESC: <<
	An armor plate constructed with layers of high temperature resilient ceramic tiles that can withstand significant incoming heat energy or shatter when impacted physically. While they are simple enough to replace they are impossible to properly repair in combat or without the aid of a dockyard.

	[img=Minus]Lower health than standard plating.[/img]
	[img=Plus]High [b][color=#c6c33a]damage resistance[/color][/b] against energy.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Moderate [b][color=#c6c33a]damage resistance[/color][/b] against other things.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Shatters absorbing significant impacts[/img]
	[img=Minus]Cannot be repaired.[/img]
	[img=Minus]When a Ceramic Armor hex is destroyed, it is permanently removed from the ship.[/img]

S_FERROFLUIDARMOR_DESC: <<
	A basin of liquid ferro-metal precisely controlled and suspended on the hull of the ship by an electromagnetic field. The ferro-metal absorbs impacts and spreads them evenly, filling any gaps that are created. The advanced electromagnetic field is configured to strongly repel traditional projectiles, and can draw back the ferro-metal to form firing ports when needed without exposing gun turrets to return fire.

	[img=Plus]High [b][color=#80ff80]health[/color][/b].[/img]
	[img=Plus]Health flows from high health hexes to connected low health hexes to equalize density.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Armor on the outside of the ship does not use up interior space.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Turrets can fire through it.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Does not provide any Damage Resistance against Energy or Explosive damage.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Heavier, more expensive and more complex than standard Liquid Armor while also being incompatible with it.[/img]
