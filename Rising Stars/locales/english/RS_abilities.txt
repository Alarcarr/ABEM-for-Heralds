ABL_SCUTTLEDERELICT: Scuttle Derelict Ship
ABL_SCUTTLEDERELICT_DESC: <<
	Sends a demolition crew to plant charges on the target derelict. The remains of the target ship are destroyed.
>>
ABL_BOARDING_PARTY: Send Boarding Party
ABL_BOARDING_PARTY_DESC: <<
	Transports a boarding party to the target object, initiating a boarding action.
	
	Boarding takes between 10 (overwhelming force on either side) and 100 (completely equal numbers) seconds to complete. If the defenders are defeated, control of the object is immediately transferred to the attacking empire. If not, nothing happens.
	
	Only one boarding action can be running on an object at any given time, and Verdant-owned objects cannot be boarded. Boarding actions cannot be initiated by ships which are already being boarded. Asteroids and orbitals always have 100 boarding strength.
>>
ABL_PROTO_LEVEL3: Form Planet (Tier 3)
ABL_PROTO_LEVEL3_DESC: Manipulate the planet's formation by expending a large amount of energy. The planet will produce a random tier 3 resource.
ABL_TELESCOPEORE_DESC: Grants vision over the targeted system for 3 minutes. Can only target systems up to $1 units away.
ABL_REPAIR: Make Repairs
ABL_REPAIR_DESC: Refits the ship, replacing damaged components to restore it to its original operational capacity.
ABL_ADD_FLOATING_CONTINENT: Claim Floating Continent
ABL_ADD_FLOATING_CONTINENT_DESC: <<
	Claim the floating continent and attach it to one of your planets to build on.

	For a cost of energy dependent on distance, the floating continent and all buildings on it can be moved to another one of your planets.

	Floating continents impede the construction of subsurface habitats and cannot be placed on planets while such construction is taking place.
>>
ABL_TRANSFER_FLOATING_CONTINENT: Move Floating Continent
ABL_TRANSFER_FLOATING_CONTINENT_DESC: <<
	Move the floating continent and all buildings on it from this planet to another one of your planets.

	The energy cost to move the floating continent is dependent on the distance between the two planets.

	This ability cannot be activated while the planet the floating continent is currently on is under siege.

	Floating continents impede the construction of subsurface habitats and cannot be placed on planets while such construction is taking place.
