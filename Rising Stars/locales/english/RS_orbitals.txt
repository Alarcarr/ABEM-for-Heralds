ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER: Power Transmitter
ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER_BLURB: Recharges the shields of allied fleets in the system.
ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER_DESC: <<
	A series of powerful generators and emitters transmits additional power to any ships in need of it. This power is then harnessed to charge up the ships' shield capacitors. However, shield activity disrupts the transmission beam, so combat will prevent continued charging.
	
	Increases the out-of-combat shield recharge rate of all ships in the system by 25, plus 0.01% of the ships' shield capacity.

ORB_GUARDIAN: Guardian Facility
ORB_GUARDIAN_BLURB: Acts as a Research-generating super-shipyard, or constructs a powerful Guardian.
ORB_GUARDIAN_DESC: <<
	An ancient shipyard of tremendous scale used to construct Guardians, the so-called 'Guardian Facility' is as valuable as the knowledge on the nearby Hubworld.

	The advanced nature of the facility's matter fabricators and the phase shifting it uses to store finished components produce an immense quantity of Research. The technology itself allows the facility to construct anything as if it were a planet, import Labor from other planets, generate 100 Labor per minute and store 5000 Labor. It cannot, however, be used to export Labor to other shipyards.

	The sheer size of the facility makes it impossible to move through conventional means, while its phasing technology causes complications when attempting to use FTL systems to propel it. Additionally, automated security systems of considerable complexity prevent boarding parties from making any progress while attacking it.

	If damaged severely enough, the Guardian Facility will shut down and phase-shift; while its location is no longer a mystery, it will have to be reactivated and repaired again.

ORB_PROGENITOR_SOLARORBITAL_BLURB: Generates energy per second relative to the temperature of the system's star. Requires no maintenance.
ORB_PROGENITOR_SOLARORBITAL_DESC: <<
	Generates extra energy per second. The higher the temperature of the star of the system it's in, the more energy is generated. Generates more energy than a regular Solar Engine. Requires no maintenance.

	Only one Solar Engine of any kind may be constructed per system.
>>
ORB_PROGENITOR_SOLARORBITAL: Advanced Solar Engine
ORB_RECALL_BLURB: Uses Energy to Recall allied flagships and orbitals to its location.
ORB_RECALL_DESC: <<
	A hyperfield manipulator designed to open a wormhole between a nearby location and any allied object in the universe.

	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Grants the Recall ability.[/img]
	[img=ResourceIcon::2;22]Costs [b][color=#42b4bd]Energy[/color][/b] to activate.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]The smaller the recalled object is, the less energy is consumed.[/img]

ORB_STELLAR_SHIELD: Stellar Shield Generator
ORB_STELLAR_SHIELD_BLURB: Adds a powerful shield to all stars in the system.
ORB_STELLAR_SHIELD_DESC: <<
	A gargantuan shield emitter, this facility envelops entire stars in a powerful shield, providing a temporary defense against weapons such as Graviton Condensers.

	Adds 1G shield capacity to every star in the system. Black holes receive 10G shield capacity. Shield regenerates at a rate of 1M per second.

	Stacks with other stellar shielding technology. Will protect indiscriminately against friendly and enemy attacks alike.
>>
ORB_EMBASSY: Embassy
ORB_EMBASSY_BLURB: Sends envoys to other planets to achieve diplomatic goals.
ORB_EMBASSY_DESC: <<
	A center of diplomatic activity, this station periodically sends out Envoys to other planets. Envoys persuade the governments of enemy planets that they would be better off under their empire's rule, and inspire the populations of allied planets into persisting long after they would normally be beaten.

	Enemy planets visited by an Envoy have a 10% chance of defecting to your empire. Planets belonging to your empire, your vassals or an empire you have an Alliance with will be immune to loyalty loss for 180 seconds.

	Diplomatic backlash gives you and your allies Leverage against anyone who would destroy the Embassy.

	High levels of diplomatic activity in the Embassy grant 2 Influence Stake, and a 5% chance of receiving a random influence card every minute.

	Embassies act as Commerce Stations and Outposts in that they allow trade between separated territories, and expand your empire's borders, respectively.

ORB_TELESCOPE: Subspace Telescope Array
ORB_TELESCOPE_BLURB: Allows temporary vision of nearby star systems. Mobile.
ORB_TELESCOPE_DESC: <<
	An array of advanced subspace telescopes, this facility can periodically consume FTL energy to obtain a real-time view of various star systems in its vicinity, and relocate itself to get a closer look.

	Has the 'Telescope' ability. Can slowly move with an acceleration of 0.2 u/s^2.
