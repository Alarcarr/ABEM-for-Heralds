ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER: Power Transmitter
ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER_BLURB: Recharges the shields of allied fleets in the system.
ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER_DESC: <<
	A series of powerful generators and emitters transmits additional power to any ships in need of it. This power is then harnessed to charge up the ships' shield capacitors. However, shield activity disrupts the transmission beam, so combat will prevent continued charging.
	
	Increases the out-of-combat shield recharge rate of all ships in the system by 25, plus 0.01% of the ships' shield capacity.

	Diplomatic backlash gives you and your allies Leverage against anyone who would destroy the Embassy.

	High levels of diplomatic activity in the Embassy grant 2 Influence Stake, and a 5% chance of receiving a random influence card every minute.

	Embassies act as Commerce Stations and Outposts in that they allow trade between separated territories, and expand your empire's borders, respectively.
