	Description: <<
		[i]The year is 714 AP. Amidst continuing conflict, alliances begin to form between the many rising empires inhabiting the galaxy. There are whispers of an ancient alien race, coming from a far away galaxy to conquer and eliminate all who would oppose them. But these whispers remain just that; whispers - and these whispers are being drowned out by war. A new, young race of warriors, hailing from the planet Rata'htat, has made its presence known to the galaxy as they launch their offensive, seeking the glory of war... and of victory...[/i]
